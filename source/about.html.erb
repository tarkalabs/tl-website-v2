            <div>
              <p>We are a team of passionate hackers, designers and product managers. We believe in experimental methods to identify the best solutions to problems instead of working on technology du jour. </p>
              <p>The word Tarka has its origins in sanskrit that loosely translates to logic in english. We view the discipline of software development as a craft. This means that we are always striving to be better craftsmen today than we were yesterday.</p>

                <blockquote>Tarka Sastra is a science of dialectics, logic and reasoning, and art of debate that analyzes the nature and source of knowledge and its validity.</blockquote>
